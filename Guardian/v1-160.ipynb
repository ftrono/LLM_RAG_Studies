    "NOTE: In a Jupyter Notebook, both `%pip` and `!pip` are used to manage Python packages, but they operate slightly differently due to the way Jupyter interprets these commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`%pip` Command**: This is a Jupyter-specific magic command. When you use `%pip`, it ensures that the package installation or any other pip operation you are performing happens in the current kernel's environment. This is important in Jupyter because notebooks can be connected to different Python environments (kernels). The `%pip` magic command helps to avoid confusion about where packages are being installed, especially in cases where you might have multiple environments or kernels. It was introduced to address the common issue where users would install a package using `!pip` and then discover it was not available in the notebook because it was installed in a different Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`!pip` Command**: This command invokes the system shell and runs `pip`, Python's package installer, as if you were running it in your terminal or command prompt. While this does effectively install or upgrade packages, it may not always install them into the kernel that the Jupyter Notebook is currently using. This is because `!pip` executes pip in the environment from which Jupyter was started, which might be different from the current notebook's kernel environment. Before the introduction of `%pip`, this could lead to confusion among users about why installed packages were not available to their notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both commands can be used to install Python packages in Jupyter Notebooks, `%pip` is more Jupyter-aware and ensures that packages are installed in the environment associated with the current notebook's kernel, thus avoiding common environment mismatch issues. It is generally recommended to use `%pip` when working in Jupyter Notebooks to ensure consistency and avoid potential confusion."
