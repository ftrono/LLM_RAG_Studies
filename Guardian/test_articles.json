            "body": "a city in northern germany has become the first to issue an all-out ban on the use of a hand gesture used to encourage silence in the classroom because of its close resemblance to a far-right turkish gesture.\nthe \"silent fox\" gesture where the hand is posed to resemble an animal with upright ears (the little and forefinger) and a closed mouth (the middle fingers pressed against the thumb) has long been seen as a useful teaching tool by educators in germany and elsewhere. it signals to children that they should stop talking and listen to their teacher.\nbut authorities in the port city of bremen say the symbol is \"in danger of being mistaken\" for the right-wing extremist \"wolf salute\", from which it is indistinguishable.\nthe salute was recently the focus of a diplomatic and sporting row, when the turkish national football player merih demiral used it to celebrate scoring a goal in turkey's round of 16 match against austria at the euros earlier this month.\nwhile the symbol not banned in germany as it is in neighbouring austria and france, its use was condemned by interior minister nancy faeser, who said \"to use the football championships as a platform for racism\" was \"completely unacceptable.\" after the summoning of turkey's ambassador to berlin and germany's ambassador to ankara, the european football governing body uefa issued demiral with a two-match ban.\nprotests over his ban led to calls among turkish fans for the symbol to be used even more widely as an expression of their anger at what the turkish president, recep tayyip erdogan, called an \"unfair and biased\" reaction. \"does anybody ask why the german national jersey has an eagle, or the french jersey a rooster?\" he asked reporters ahead of turkey's quarter-final encounter with the netherlands in berlin.\nerdogan said the ban was politically motivated, and that demiral had merely used the gesture to show his excitement.\ngermany is home to an estimated 3 million ethnic turks, who make up the country's largest single ethnic minority and form the largest turkish diaspora globally.\npatricia brandt, a spokesperson for bremen's education authority, said the topic of the silent fox gesture and whether to ban it had long been under discussion but the city felt it now had no choice. \"the political meaning of the hand gesture is absolutely incompatible with the values of the city of bremen,\" she said.\nbut she added that increasingly teachers had anyway considered the gesture to be \"pedagogically outdated\", and its \"regulatory style\" to be too dogmatic and condescending.\nthe wolf salute is the symbol and identifying logo of the grey wolves, which is classified as a rightwing extremist group and has an estimated 20,000 members in germany and many more outside the country. grey wolves is described by extremism experts as hardline nationalist and islamist, with hatred shown to kurds, jews, christians, armenians, greeks, the eu and the us. the group, which has a long history of terrorism dating back to the 1970s, has been blamed for bomb attacks in paris and bangkok, and the attempt on the life of pope john paul ii in 1981.\nthe silent fox symbol is used not just in germany but by teachers around the world, and is known variously as the whispering fox, the listening fox, and as the quiet coyote in the us.\nthe bremen ban follows a wider debate in germany. the president of the german teachers' association, stefan dull, called last week for teachers to show greater sensitivity in its use at primary schools and kindergartens. he said there were other ways of encouraging children to be quiet.\nsome schools have reportedly started using gongs and other sign language or picture symbols instead."

            "body": "during the very short amount of time he has spent at the top of his sport, carlos alcaraz has already enjoyed a career with few comparisons. alcaraz is winning big titles at a rate that few 21-year-olds ever have yet it still seems like he has barely scratched at the surface of his talents. every win brings him closer to the possibility that he will soon be the dominant force in his sport.\nhe took another leap forward in his blossoming career by producing an incredible performance under pressure and holding off his late nerves to defeat the seven-time champion novak djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (4) and triumph at wimbledon for a second time in a row. alcaraz has now won four major titles and counting and he joins roger federer as the only men to win their first four grand slam finals.\nrelated: carlos alcaraz v novak djokovic: wimbledon 2024 men's singles final live with this monumental victory, alcaraz also joins a rare group of six players who have wonat roland garros and wimbledon in the same year, nowadays sometimes known as the \"channel slam\". this is also alcaraz's first ever grand slam title defence and it marks the first time he has won multiple grand slam titles in the same year.\nafter tearing his meniscus during the french open and quickly undergoing surgery, djokovic's run to the final alone was incredibly impressive in itself. but the 37-year-old had also reached the final without facing a single top 10 opponent the ninth seed alex de minaur withdrew before their quarter- final match meaning he had not been tested by one of the elite.\nmore importantly, nothing in djokovic's path to the final prepared him for the excellence of alcaraz. a year ago, the spaniard demonstrated his mental strength and nerve in a delirious five-set comeback victory over djokovic to win his first wimbledon title in an instant classic. the start of the sequel suggested that another long afternoon could be on the cards as alcaraz wrestled a mammoth 13-minute opening game from djokovic to immediately break serve.\nthe winner of the final point of that first game turned out to be far more significant. while alcaraz settled immediately and constantly looked to take the first strike, djokovic seemed to be terrified of trading with his opponent from the baseline. he was determined to shorten points by approaching the net as early as possible and throwing in numerous serve and volley attempts.\nalcaraz easily picked djokovic off whenever he tried to approach and by the time the spaniard led 6-2, 2-0, djokovic had won just four of his 14 net approaches.\neven as he established an early lead, it took a while for alcaraz to reach his top level. every game on the board seemed to free him up a little more as he worked through his arsenal of shots, launching himself into nuclear forehands, closing down the net and keeping djokovic guessing with a steady helping of drop shots.\nwhile djokovic's movement has been solid during the fortnight, he has been cautious about sliding and pushing back off his right knee when forced out wide on his forehand side. time after time, alcaraz made djokovic scramble in his forehand corner and he struck his down-the-line backhand well. as he rolled through to establish a two-set lead, he had made djokovic's life so uncomfortable.\neven when he trailed by two sets, djokovic searched for solutions, served well and he put alcaraz under considerable pressure. it was not until alcaraz reached 5-4, 40-0 and triple championship point, though, that he finally balked. after a double fault and a fine forehand return from djokovic, an excellent serve from alcaraz set up a forehand drive volley. just as he was about to strike the ball, a spectator screamed out from the crowd. alcaraz missed that forehand and two more as he quickly relinquished the game.\nto his credit, even when djokovic followed up the break by holding easily to lead 6-5, alcaraz did not panic. he held serve, forced a tiebreak and then he played an outrageous drop shot winner at 5-4 as he found the courage to force himself back onto the front foot to close out a brilliant win the hard way."

            "body": "donald trump joins a long line of us presidents and candidates for the white house who have faced attempts on their lives over more than 150 years.\n**abraham lincoln** was the first us president to be killed while in office, when he was shot in the head from behind while attending a theatre in washington, in 1865. lincoln died the next day.\nhis murderer was john wilkes booth, a former actor and fervent supporter of the pro-slavery confederate side in the us civil war, which was ongoing at the time.\nsixteen years later, in july 1881, **james garfield,** who had been a civil war general, was assassinated after serving just six months in office. he was shot while walking through a station in washington and died of complications a few weeks later.\ngarfield's killer, charles guiteau, who had been turned down for a diplomatic posting, had been stalking the president for weeks. he was later hanged for the crime.\npresident **william mckinley,** who had also fought in the civil war, was shot in the chest at point blank range in buffalo, new york, in september 1901 and died a few days later of gangrene caused by the wounds.\nhis killer was leon czolgosz, an anarchist. it was after mckinley's assassination that congress passed legislation giving the secret service the formal role of protecting presidents.\nthe assassination of **john f kennedy** , captured on broadcast footage as he travelled through dallas in a motorcade in november 1963, has been the subject of countless books, documentaries and conspiracy theories.\nthe gunman, lee harvey oswald, was himself shot dead two days later while in the custody of police, as he was being taken to the county jail. kennedy was succeeded by his vice-president, lyndon b johnson, who was re-elected by a landslide a year later.\njohn f kennedy's brother, **robert f kennedy** , known as bobby, a key figure in jfk's white house, was shot while running in the democratic primaries as a potential presidential candidate in 1968.\nhe had been addressing supporters at a hotel in los angeles, and died the following day. his son and namesake, robert f kennedy jr, is running as an independent in the current presidential race, with his policies including opposing vaccines.\nas well as these five successful assassination attempts, several other presidents and former presidents have been targeted over the years, most recently **ronald reagan**.\nin march 1981, reagan was leaving the hilton hotel in washington, where he had been addressing trade unionists, when several shots were fired, one of which hit the president under his arm. he spent 12 days in hospital and later said that \"getting shot hurts\".\nother presidents who were targeted include **theodore roosevelt** , who was shot and wounded in 1912, after leaving office, while campaigning to return to the white house.\na bullet passed through roosevelt's glasses case and a copy of his 50-page speech to lodge in his chest. judging that he had not been seriously wounded, roosevelt delivered the speech before submitting to medical examination.\nroosevelt had become president in 1901 after mckinley was assassinated. the man who attempted to murder him, john schrank, believed he had been instructed to do so by mckinley's ghost.\n**gerald ford** survived two murder attempts in a single year in 1975, both by women. the first failed because there was no bullet in the firing chamber, and the second because a bystander grabbed the arm of the would-be assassin sara jane moore as she was about to fire."

            "trailText": "American actor who found fame playing the wholesome teen Brenda Walsh in the television series Beverly Hills 90210",
            "body": "the slick television series beverly hills 90210, which focused on the lives and loves of young, privileged los angelenos, was first aired in 1990 to fairly low ratings and general indifference. as it began tackling serious issues relevant to its young audience, it grew into a phenomenon that ran throughout the decade and came to define it culturally; the new york times credited it with single-handedly inventing the teen soap opera.\nthe show reached us audiences of more than 21 million and made worldwide stars of its main cast members, luke perry, jason priestley and shannen doherty.\ndoherty, who has died aged 53 of cancer, played the wholesome brenda walsh, whose family, including her twin brother brendan (priestley), arrives in california from minnesota in the first episode.\nshortly after enrolling at west beverly hills high, brenda starts breaking rules, procuring a fake id to enter a nightclub and dating a supposed bad boy, dylan (perry), against her father's wishes. the first season ends with her losing her virginity, while the second begins with her believing herself to be pregnant. her mother is aghast at the transformation: \"you didn't wear this much makeup in minnesota,\" she says.\ndoherty believed the show was performing an important function. \"we represent situations to our audience, and i don't think we take a side,\" she told rolling stone magazine in 1992. \"it's something that brings families together.\" the great responsibility she felt towards her audience also influenced the material. \"in one episode, they had my character wanting to lose weight, like eight pounds or something. i'm fairly thin, and with bulimia and anorexia such big problems, i was concerned that these girls who look up to me might take it the wrong way.\" the producers agreed to remove the offending scenes from the show.\nshe stuck around for a total of four seasons, departing under a cloud in 1994.\n\"shannen's behaviour in the fourth year really indicated that she was very unhappy being here,\" said the series showrunner, charles rosin, in 2008. \"she was habitually late. and finally one day she showed up late, and the cast got very angry, and they called [the producer aaron] spelling, and he did not renew her contract. he gave her the face-saving moment to say that she didn't want to come back.\" for her part, doherty felt she had been misrepresented. \"if you consider 'difficult' being a strong woman who sticks up for herself, yeah, i admit to it. i'm open to different ideas, but if you get on my bad side and don't listen to me and you don't treat me with as much respect as you treat a man, you've got a problem.\" the show ran for a further six seasons without her, though she was back on board in 2008 for the first two seasons of a revived version, now called simply 90210 and populated largely by new, younger cast members.\nmore interesting was a further show, bh90210, which aired for a single season in 2019 and adopted a postmodern approach, following some of the original cast playing heightened versions of themselves as they try to get a reboot of the show off the ground. doherty, who had initially been reluctant to participate, signed up after expressing a wish to honour perry, who died in march 2019.\n(his death was mentioned in the first episode of bh90210.) she was born in memphis, tennessee, and moved to southern california at the age of six with her mother, rosa (nee wright), who owned a beauty salon, and her father, tom doherty, who was a mortgage consultant. she was educated at the lycee francais in los angeles. as a child, she convinced her parents to take her to acting auditions, and got her first television role in 1981, at the age of 10, on the drama father murphy.\nthe following year, she was a regular on the ninth and final season of the popular little house on the prairie and in three of that show's subsequent tv specials. she had a recurring role on the drama our house (1986-88) and appeared in films including the black comedy heathers (1989) but later said she had struggled to find work during this period. \"i got offered every horror film in the book, and i said 'no' to every single one of them because i wasn't willing to compromise, to sacrifice the art.\" just in time, she auditioned successfully for beverly hills 90210.\nafter leaving the show, she played the lead in kevin smith's ramshackle comedy mallrats (1995). savaged by critics, the film flopped but later found an enthusiastic following on video and dvd. she had more success on the long- running series charmed, which began in 1998, and in which she played one of three sisters who fight evil using witchcraft; she also directed several episodes.\nher marriages to the actor ashley hamilton and the poker player rick salomon both ended in divorce. the preparations for her wedding to kurt iswarienko, her third husband, whom she married in 2011, were shown in detail on the eight-part reality tv show shannen says (2012), with the final episode featuring the ceremony itself. doherty filed for divorce from iswarienko last year.\ndoherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 but went into remission in 2018. it was in early 2020, in the midst of publicising her fight against insurers who refused to pay out for the damage to her house in malibu from a wildfire in california, that she revealed the illness had returned and was now terminal, and in 2023 she announced that the cancer had spread to her brain.\nshe is survived by her mother, rosa, and her older brother, sean.\nshannen maria doherty, actor, born 12 april 1971; died 13 july 2024"

            "body": "it was eight hours before kickoff and mike burrow from wigan, was walking his son george just as close to the olympiastadion as the scaffolding of barriers erected by uefa would allow.\n\"united by football,\" the ever-present marketing shouted. well, maybe. \"we are just soaking in the atmosphere,\" said burrow, 42, who has lived in germany for more than a decade and is married to a local woman.\nhe had on the white of england, while george, five, licking on an ice lolly, was in the red away strip in which bobby moore lifted the last trophy in 1966.\nthey didn't have tickets but had wanted in on the action, burrow explained.\nnot that there were many people around the stadium on berlin's leafy outskirts at this hour.\nare you excited, burrow asked of his son? there was a little shake of the head and another lick of the lolly.\nit felt a bit like dad had written the schedule for the day. \"we will have a little walk around here and then go into the city,\" said burrow. \"probably get a bit overwhelmed by all the people and go back home,\" he said with a laugh.\n\"we are having a party later. i think we could just nick it. but my first memory of a tournament is italy in 90 so not been a lot of success. we've grown into the tournament though.\" it is a stereotype, but it is also true that an england men's game can be an excuse for young men to cut loose. there is plenty of boozing and raucous, sometimes offensive, behaviour. there are an estimated 50,000 england fans in berlin for england's european championship final against spain. a headline on a story in the german tabloid bild about the night before read: \"england fans drink, pee, and fight.\" the accompanying photographs bore witness to english fans being arrested, urinating into the spree river that runs through berlin and being treated for cuts and bruises. but this is just one part of the story.\nengland games of this scale and it does not get any bigger than the country's second major tournament final in 58 years are also about family, identity and memories. it is notable just how many families have travelled to berlin, some with young children, but it is more often dads in their 50s and 60s with their grownup sons, hoping gareth southgate's team can create some special moments for them. a win, preferably.\nlewis garratty, 25, an accountant from blackburn, had joined his dad, peter, 62, in germany after england beat the netherlands and they sourced a couple of tickets online for 1,500 each.\nwith them on the adventure was craig duncan, 57 who now owns an estate agents but who previously served on hms avenger with peter during their royal navy days and his son tom, 28, a recruitment consultant.\n\"tom lives in amsterdam and i was visiting him anyway and then we just bought the tickets on the train here,\" said craig. why do it? \"well, it's my son,\" he said. \"i went to italia 90, won tickets from the saint & greavsie [itv] show, funnily enough. and did the euros in france. i think we can do it. it's about time, our turn.\" the travelling supporters of many international teams love a fan zone. that is not the case for the english support. they instead tend to split into two camps: those who go their own way and have a wander around the host city, and those who find the most central irish pub and make it their base.\nmurphy's irish pub by the weidendammer bridge, where friedrichstrae crosses the spree river in the central mitte district of berlin, was the preferred location for many hundreds of fans in the hours before kick-off. england flags claimed ownership of little patches of the river edge all the way down both sides of the spree, each emblazoned with writing to identify their owners.\narsenal away. brentford. chesterfield fc. these are the visible platoons of modern-day england, but it is the family that is the origin of \"the little platoon we belong to in society\", as the philosopher edmund burke said.\nashley creed, 33, a builder from didcot was looking over from the weidendammer bridge at the singing supporters spilling out from murphy's on the riverside.\nhe was holding the hand of his son mason, eight. and with them was ashley's dad, anthony, 62, also a builder. \"my dad was gutted that he couldn't come and he is 86,\" said anthony.\nwhy had they come as a family? it had cost them 2,000 each for tickets to the final. \"our time has come,\" said ashley. \"i haven't seen it, my dad hasn't seen it but my son might get the chance to see it today.\""

            "body": "adam simpson tossed the coin, waved to the crowd and went on his way. \"let's get on with it,\" he said. west coast gave them a scare but brisbane were too good in the end. for eagles fans, it was time to give thanks and move on. for others, it was a chance to reflect on how this sport is covered, and how its people are treated.\nwhenever a coach loses his job, there's usually a villain the journo who breaches trust, the player who leaks, the board member who knifes. in this instance, it was the west australian __ newspaper, which ran with a tasteless but hardly atypical front page \" _see ya simmo\",_ with a conga line of 'ls'.\nrelated: from the pocket: patrick cripps reaches milestone after having to scrap the whole way in recent times, the newspaper has trafficked in outlandish, almost cartoonish front and back pages. some are vicious. some are actually quite funny. most, like the dozens devoted to harley reid in the past 12 months, are pretty harmless. the editorial thought process is clear we'll piss off all the usual suspects on the eastern seaboard, triple our clicks and in a few days there'll be some other outrage.\neven wayne carey slammed this one however. \"this paper is run by children,\" will schofield posted on x. \"the fourth estate in western australia is the source of weirdness,\" gerard whateley said. \"that is one of the most disgraceful things i've seen in football,\" his afl 360 co-host mark robinson said.\non any given day however, you could pick up robinson's own newspaper and read something whether it's about asylum seekers, drug addicts or any other easy target that's more offensive than what the west australian __ dished up.\nindeed, his monday column, \"the tackle\", isn't exactly renowned for its restraint. hours before he lashed out, robinson published a column headlined \"simpson's death was by 1000 bad quarters\".\n the front page of wednesday's the west australian.\n pic.twitter.com/u3cqvxtehg\n -- the west australian (@westaustralian) july 9, 2024 this isn't a \"whack mark robinson\" column. when it comes to the human side of football former players struggling with the effects of concussion, neale daniher's fight with mnd, and so on there's no-one in the football media who handles those stories better. but he has never quite come to terms with the fact that, on the whole, nine teams lose every weekend, and that they don't play poorly simply to irritate him. robinson often reacts to losses and poor performances as though someone has just set fire to his house. and like so many who directed their anger towards a smartarse, sub-editing sandgroper, he can be pretty savage himself.\nrobinson is a leading voice in an afl media industry that treats coach sackings as a sport, and that hands out gongs to the journalists who break the stories first. it's an industry that puts up betting markets on the first coach to be shown the door, and that bags them when they refuse to be interviewed, when they lose their temper in the box, when their moustache isn't \"good optics\", and when they display too much emotion after a narrow win. when coaches are eventually sacked, it's an industry that calls for \"humane\" cullings, that says things like \"gee, he spoke well\" and that then decries a lack of journalistic standards out west.\nrelated: fremantle's top-four spot suggests a deep run into september and beyond | craig little for years, coaches have been telling the media that a line has been crossed.\n\"coaches feel like the scum of the industry,\" caroline wilson said last year.\neven craig mcrae spoke of the enormous toll it takes on his wellbeing and family life. \"you guys can be cruel sometimes,\" simpson said at his departing press conference. \"it is a stressful existence,\" chris scott said on footy classified a few years ago, in response to wilson's \"elephant in the room\" segment. \"it is not a very good job, to be honest,\" scott added. when don pyke lost his job at adelaide, in the same week that danny frawley had died, he spoke on what can be a pitiless industry, one that \"is leading to a wide range of issues around contentment.\" robinson compared the coverage of simpson to the darkest days of fleet street.\nbut we're a long way off that. \"goodbye tosser\" was sven-goran eriksson's farewell in the sun. \"we've sold our birthright down the fjord to a nation of seven million skiers and hammer throwers who spend half their lives in darkness,\" one columnist wrote. the late graham taylor was treated even more disgracefully, with the sun superimposing a turnip on his forehead beneath the headline \"that's your allotment turnip taylor turns up his toes\".\ncompared with that, the west australian's coverage was almost civil. its front page was crass and grubby. but it was more consistent with the overall tone and tenor of how the game is covered than many of the industry's key voices care to admit. there's a lot of po-faces, a lot of glass houses, a lot of stones being thrown, and a refusal to listen to what sacked coaches are trying to tell us."
