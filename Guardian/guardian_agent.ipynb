      "the former president called for national unity and resilience, in a country deeply divided amid the tumultuous 2024 election, where joe biden's re- election campaign as the presumptive democratic nominee has been thrown into crisis by his shaky performance while trump is expected to be anointed as the republican nominee at the party's convention this week with a hard-right agenda.\n",
      "trump posted on his social media platform: \"i knew immediately that something was wrong in that i heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin ... much bleeding took place,\" then further posted on sunday that \"it is more important than ever that we stand united, and show our true character as americans, remaining strong and determined, and not allowing evil to win\", also adding that \"it was god alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening\".\n",
      "as trump clutched at his ear and ducked to the floor, a number of secret service agents raced to the stage to encircle and protect him. the presidential candidate lost his shoes in the confusion, and called to be reunited with them as he was bundled off to safety. but he also stuck out a raised fist and exhorted \"fight! fight!'\" to the crowd as press cameras furiously snapped photos.\n",
      "\"i was hoping it was just a prank, that it was a bad joke,\" rally attendee blake marnell, who was sat in the front row, told the guardian.\n",
      "trump, marnell said, was \"essentially being tackled to the ground by the secret service\".\n",

      "\"i saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head and died instantly,\" joseph meyn, a surgeon from grove city, pennsylvania, told cnn, describing a chaotic and bloody scene.\n",
      "other trump family members who have shared their reactions are his sons donald trump jr and eric trump.\n",
      "donald trump jr tweeted a photo of his father holding his fist in the air while being guarded by secret service agents in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, stating: \"he'll never stop fighting for america.\" eric trump also posted the photo of his father, adding, \"this is the fighter america needs!\" trump's ex-wife marla maples, who has recently floated the possibility of running as his vice-presidential candidate as he seeks a return to the oval office in november, asked for prayers for him on x.\n",
      "she also requested prayers on behalf of her daughter with trump, tiffany, adding: \"we ... know he is leading on behalf of all of us.\" republican, democratic, and world leaders have issued statements condemning the shooting, which trump said resulted in a bullet piercing the upper part of his right ear.\n",
      "he posted on x, formerly twitter, that \"the american people deserve to know the truth\" and said that the us secret service director, kimberly cheatle, and \"other appropriate officials\" from the department of homeland security and the fbi would be required to appear for congressional hearings as soon as possible.\n",
      "congressman mike turner, the republican chair of the house intelligence committee, said on sunday that \"along with donald trump, our democracy dodged a bullet\" during the shooting in butler country, western pennsylvania.\n",
      "interactive the incident is being investigated as an attempted assassination and is the first time a president or leading party candidate for the white house has been shot since ronald reagan in 1981. bomb-making materials were found in the vehicle and home of the suspect, the wall street journal and the associated press reported on sunday, citing unnamed law enforcement officials.\n",
      "interactive asked how he felt, he told bbc one's sunday with laura kuenssberg: \"i was very upset and i'm still upset. i'm obviously pleased that my friend donald has got away with it, only just, but he's got away with it. the narrative that is put out there about trump by the liberals that oppose him is so nasty, so unpleasant, that i think it almost encourages this type of behaviour.\" farage said he blamed the \"mainstream media narrative\" and \"liberal intolerance\", though he accepted there was violent language used about political opponents. \"i've faced continual attacks for over a decade now because it's me, no one cares - in fact, it's even funny.\" farage, who had milkshake and wet cement thrown at him during the election campaign, said it was making it harder for politicians to meet voters, adding: \"the problem with this is, how do you go out and campaign? \"think of john major 30 years ago, a soapbox in market squares, you couldn't do that today. so we finish up with our political\n",
      "trump's wife, former first lady melania trump, issued a statement saying: \"america, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered, but our courage and common sense must ascend and bring us back together as one. when i watched that violent bullet strike my husband, donald, i realized my life, and (son) barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change.\" \"a monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to [w]ring out donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. the core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. donald, the generous and caring man who i have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\" she concluded: \"this morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple- minded ideas that ignite violence.\" the political leanings of crooks were not immediately clear. records show crooks was registered as a republican voter in pennsylvania, but federal\n"
